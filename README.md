# ChargerWallet Bridge

You could obtain binary files and installer packages at [release](https://github.com/chargerwallet/chargerwallet-bridge/releases) page

## How To Build (Both binary and installer)

Please refer to [Build.md](Build.md)

All version numbers are controlled by `VERSION` at root level, no need to change other files

For things work properly , be sure to follow build methods documented in [Build.md](Build.md)

## Emulator support

ChargerWallet bridge has emulator support, but it's disabled by default.

To enable emulator support, launch with `-e` parameter followed by port, for example `./chargerwalletd -e 21324`

To disable all USB in order to run on some virtual environments,launch with `-u=false` parameter, for example `./chargerwalletd -u=false`

If you want change default launch options,  you may have to change service accordingly

## Edit Default Service Launch Options

On Linux, `sudo systemctl edit --full chargerwalletd.service` to edit the service control file

On MacOS, open `/Library/LaunchAgents/com.chargerwallet.bridge.chargerwalletd.plist` to edit the service control file

On Windows, open `shell:startup` folder, then edit the `ChargerWallet Bridge.lnk` file

## API documentation

`chargerwallet-bridge` starts a HTTP server on `http://localhost:21320`. AJAX calls are only enabled from chargerwallet.com subdomains.

Server supports following API calls:

| url <br> method | parameters | result type | description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `/` <br> POST | | {`version`:&nbsp;string} | Returns current version of bridge |
| `/enumerate` <br> POST | | Array&lt;{`path`:&nbsp;string, <br>`session`:&nbsp;string&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;null}&gt; | Lists devices.<br>`path` uniquely defines device between more connected devices. Two different devices (or device connected and disconnected) will return different paths.<br>If `session` is null, nobody else is using the device; if it's string, it identifies who is using it. |
| `/listen` <br> POST | request body: previous, as JSON | like `enumerate` | Listen to changes and returns either on change or after 30 second timeout. Compares change from `previous` that is sent as a parameter. "Change" is both connecting/disconnecting and session change. |
| `/acquire/PATH/PREVIOUS` <br> POST | `PATH`: path of device<br>`PREVIOUS`: previous session (or string "null") | {`session`:&nbsp;string} | Acquires the device at `PATH`. By "acquiring" the device, you are claiming the device for yourself.<br>Before acquiring, checks that the current session is `PREVIOUS`.<br>If two applications call `acquire` on a newly connected device at the same time, only one of them succeed. |
| `/release/SESSION`<br>POST | `SESSION`: session to release | {} | Releases the device with the given session.<br>By "releasing" the device, you claim that you don't want to use the device anymore. |
| `/call/SESSION`<br>POST | `SESSION`: session to call<br><br>request body: hexadecimal string | hexadecimal string | Both input and output are hexadecimal, encoded in following way:<br>first 2 bytes (4 characters in the hexadecimal) is the message type<br>next 4 bytes (8 in hex) is length of the data<br>the rest is the actual encoded protobuf data.<br>Protobuf messages are defined in [this protobuf file](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-common/blob/master/protob/messages.proto) and the app, calling chargerwallet, should encode/decode it itself. |
| `/post/SESSION`<br>POST | `SESSION`: session to call<br><br>request body: hexadecimal string | 0 | Similar to `call`, just doesn't read response back. Usable mainly for debug link. |
| `/read/SESSION`<br>POST | `SESSION`: session to call | 0 | Similar to `call`, just doesn't post, only reads. Usable mainly for debug link. |

## Debug link support

ChargerWallet Bridge has support for debug link.

To support an emulator with debug link, run

`./chargerwalletd -ed 21324:21320 -u=false`

this will detect emulator debug link on port 21320, with regular device on 21324.

To support WebUSB devices with debug link, no option is needed, just run chargerwallet-bridge.

In the `enumerate` and `listen` results, there are now two new fields: `debug` and `debugSession`. `debug` signals that device can receive debug link messages.

Session management is separate for debug link and normal interface, so you can have two applications - one controlling ChargerWallet and one "normal".

There are new calls:

* `/debug/acquire/PATH`, which has the same path as normal `acquire`, and returns a `SESSION`
* `/debug/release/SESSION` releases session
* `/debug/call/SESSION`, `/debug/post/SESSION`, `/debug/read/SESSION` work as with normal interface

The session IDs for debug link start with the string "debug".
